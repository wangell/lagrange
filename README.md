# Lagrange

Lagrange is a desktop GUI client for browsing [Geminispace](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/). It offers modern conveniences familiar from web browsers, such as smooth scrolling, inline image viewing, multiple tabs, visual themes, Unicode fonts, bookmarks, history, and page outlines.

Like Gemini, Lagrange has been designed with minimalism in mind. It depends on a small number of essential libraries. It is written in C and uses [SDL](https://libsdl.org/) for hardware-accelerated graphics. [OpenSSL](https://openssl.org/) is used for secure communications.
